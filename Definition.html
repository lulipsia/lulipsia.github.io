        <main>
             <p>Swing dance is a group of <em>social dances</em> that developed with the swing style of jazz music in the <time>1920s–1940s</time>, with the origins of each dance predating the popular <i>"swing era"</i>. Hundreds of styles of swing dancing were developed; those that have survived beyond that era include <class="dancestyle">Charleston</class>, <class="dancestyle">Balboa</class>, <class="dancestyle">Lindy Hop</class>, and <class="dancestyle">Collegiate Shag</class>.<a href="Definition.html#[2]">[2]</a><a href="/Definition.html#[3]">[3]</a> Today, the best-known of these dances is the <class="dancestyle">Lindy Hop</class>, which originated in Harlem in the early <time>1930s</time> .<a href="/Definition.html#[4]">[4]</a> While the majority of swing dances began in African-American communities as <i>vernacular African-American dances</i> , some influenced swing-era dances, like <class="dancestyle">Balboa</class>, developed outside of these communities.</p>
             
             <p><em>"Swing dance"</em> was not commonly used to identify a group of dances until the latter half of the <time>20th century</time>. Historically, the term <em>swing</em> referred to the style of jazz music, which inspired the evolution of the dance. <i>Jitterbug</i> is any form of swing dance, though it is often used as a synonym for the six-count derivative of <class="dancestyle">Lindy Hop</class> called <class="dancestyle">"East Coast Swing"</class>.<a href="/Definition.html#[5]">[5]</a> It was also common to use the word to identify a kind of dancer (i.e., a swing dancer). A <i>"jitterbug"</i> might prefer to dance <class="dancestyle">Lindy Hop</class>, <class="dancestyle">Shag</class>, or any of the other swing dances. The term was famously associated with swing era band leader Cab Calloway because, as he put it, <blockquote>"[The dancers] look like a bunch of jitterbugs out there on the floor due to their fast, often bouncy movements."</blockquote> <a href="/Definition.html#[6]">[6]</a></p>

             <p>The term <em>"swing dancing"</em> is often extended to include other dances that do not have certain characteristics of traditional swing dances: West Coast Swing, Carolina Shag, East Coast Swing, Hand Dancing, Jive, Rock and Roll, Modern Jive, and other dances developed during the <time>1940s</time> and later. A strong tradition of social and competitive boogie woogie and Rock 'n' Roll in Europe add these dances to their local swing dance cultures. <a href="/Definition.html#[]">[7]</a></p>

            <h5>Types of Swing Dances</h5>
            <details>
                <summary>Lindy Hop</summary>
                    <p>Lindy Hop is most likely one of the most popular Swing Dances. It originated in the African-American communities of Harlem, New York City, in 1928 and has evolved since then. It is a fusion of many dances that preceded it or were popular during its development but is mainly based on jazz, tap, breakaway, and <class="dancestyle">Charleston</class></p>
                <summary>Charleston</summary>
                    <p>The Charleston is a dance named after the harbor city of Charleston, South Carolina. The rhythm was popularized in mainstream dance music in the United States by a <time>1923</time> tune called "The Charleston" by composer/pianist James P. Johnson. Today Charleston is danced in many permutations: alone (solo), with a partner, or in groups of couples or solo dancers. The basic step allows for a vast range of variations and improvisation. Both the 20s and Swinging Charleston styles are popular today, though swinging Charleston is more commonly integrated into Lindy Hop dancing.</p>
                <summary>Balboa</summary>
                    <p>The Balboa, also known as <i>"Bal"</i>, is a swing dance that originated in Southern California during the <time>1920s</time> and enjoyed huge popularity during the <time>1930s</time> and <time>1940s</time>.Balboa is an 8-count dance that is done in closed position. The earliest form of the dance (often called <i>"Pure Balboa"</i>) evolved in the mostly conservative dance halls of southern California where space was limited and strict codes of conduct were enforced. These dance halls usually prohibited the wild kicks of the <class="dancestyle">Charleston</class> and swing-outs of <class="dancestyle">Lindy Hop</class>. Pure Balboa is characterized by an upright posture with partners standing chest to chest. Step variations generally play with the rhythm or look and feel (style) from below the knee downwards and deal with changes in direction. Balboa is frequently danced to fast jazz (usually anything from 180 to 320 <abbr title="Beats per minute">BPM</abbr>), though many like a slower (170-190 <abbr title="Beats per minute">BPM</abbr>) tempo. While most dancers differentiate between pure Balboa and Bal-Swing, both are considered to be a part of the dance.</p>
                <summary>Shag</summary>
                    <p>"Shag" itself (when used in reference to American social dances) is a very broad term used to denote a number dances that originated in the first half of the <time>20th century</time>.: The <class="dancestyle">Carolina Shag</class>, which originated in South Carolina in the <time>1940s</time>  and is still their state dance, the <class="dancestyle">Collegiate Shag</class>, which originated in the <time>1920s</time> and the St. Louis Shag, which evolved from the <class="dancestyle">Charleston</class>. They mainly only share the name and are otherwise independent swing dances.</p>
